# Flowchart

A very simple command line utility that tells you what to do next.

## Installation

	$ npm install -g flowchart

## Usage

    $ flowchart git-undo

The above command will help you figure out how to undo a change in Git, 
based on [@emmajanehw's diagram](https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/549919920990208000).

In fact, that diagram is the original raison d'Ãªtre for this app. The plan to add more
like it over time. 

## Adding your own flowcharts

Have a look at the [flowcharts/git-undo](./flowcharts/git-undo). All you have to do is
add a new file to the flowcharts directory. Or create a directory under your home (`~`)
directory called `flowcharts` and put files there. Or type:

	$ flowchart play
